# Financial-Forecasting-Frontier

## Overview
In the modern banking sector, efficiently processing and analyzing vast amounts of financial data is critical for customer service, risk management, marketing strategies, and overall operational efficiency. This project, Financial Forecasting Frontier, leverages Hadoop, Hive, and classification models to transform large-scale banking data into actionable insights.

## Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how distributed machine learning can enhance banking data analysis. Using Hadoop, Hive, Apache Spark, and machine learning models, this project aims to:
‚úÖ Efficiently store and manage large banking datasets
‚úÖ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Apache Spark
‚úÖ Develop predictive models for customer behavior and risk assessment
‚úÖ Implement real-time transaction analysis using Spark Streaming
‚úÖ Utilize data parallelism to enhance performance

## Tech Stack
* Programming Language: Python üêç
* Big Data Frameworks: Apache Hadoop, Apache Hive üèóÔ∏è
* Distributed Computing: Apache Spark, Spark Streaming ‚ö°
* Machine Learning: Spark ML, Classification Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) üìä
* Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn üìà

##  Project Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage & Querying: Store banking data in Hadoop HDFS and use Hive for SQL-based queries.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform data cleaning, visualization, and trend analysis with Apache Spark.
